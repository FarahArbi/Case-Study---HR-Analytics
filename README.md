## ðŸ“‚ Dataset and Data Modeling
For this case study, we adopt the Kimball modeling approach, including a Fact table storing yearly employee reviews and multiple dimension tables to provide contextual information. The data model adheres to a snowflake schema. We initiate by loading and preparing our dataset in Power BI, ensuring data cleanliness and appropriate table naming conventions (Fact or Dim). 

- Fact Table: Stores yearly employee performance reviews, including satisfaction ratings and review dates.
- Dimension Tables: Provide contextual information such as employee demographics, education level, satisfaction levels, and rating levels
